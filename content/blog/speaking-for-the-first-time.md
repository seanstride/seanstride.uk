I have just been a speaker at a meetup I have been attending for a few months now. This is the first time I have ever done anything like this. The meetup was well attended I believe there was 100 people. It was a great feeling knowing so many people were learning from my content.

The submission process did not go as smoothly as I would have liked. I proposed the presentation to the event organiser a month before the event. I found out a week after being accepted that the one and only Scott Hanselman would be presenting the same subject matter at a user group that is very closely linked to the one that I was due to present at.

The content I presented seemed to go down well. I only had a small demo but we all know the demo gods can not be looking down on us regardless of size, so I was happy that that went smoothly. The feedback from the audience when I had chance to chat to them after the event was extremely positive, which was so good to hear. I can't wait to find the time and a subject to allow me to present again.

The presentation slides I used for this are available below:
